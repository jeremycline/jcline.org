I am thrilled to say that last week I became the newest member of the Fedora
Engineering team. I will be working on the applications that help the Fedora
community create a fantastic Linux distribution. I'm excited to be joining the
team and I look forward to working with everyone!

Previously, I worked on the [Pulp](http://pulpproject.org/) project, which is
a content management system used in [Red Hat Satellite 6](
https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite). I learned a great deal
while working with some excellent engineers on this project.
