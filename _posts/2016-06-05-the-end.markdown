For a long time I've allowed [jcline.org](https://www.jcline.org) to simply
serve the default welcome page for Apache. I decided to change that today, so
I naturally started a blog. I don't have much to blog about, so this is likely
the first and last blog post, but at least it's slightly more interesting than
the old welcome page.
