About Me
--------

I'm Jeremy Cline. This is my personal blog where I write about software and
whatever else interests me. I am employed by
[Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/) to work on various Linux upstream
communities, but any opinions expressed here are entirely my own and not my
employers past, present, or future.

Previously, I was employed by [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/) to work on the
[Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) project, the Linux kernel, and various other
free and open source projects.

You can contact me in many ways:
